        <h1>OGBONO SOUP RECIPE</h1>
        <p>
         Ogbono soup is a Nigerian  soup made with ground Ogbono  (wild African mango) seeds. Ogbono soup is very popular and the method of preparation differs from tribe to tribe. This is my mum’s method of preparation and it has never failed me.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Note: DO NOT cover the pot after the Ogbono has been added, covering the pot will make the soup watery and cause the Ogbono to lose its slimy consistency. Covering the pot is a definite NO NO!</strong></p>
<h1>INGREDIENTS</h1>
Assorted meats (Ponmo, Shaki, Bokoto, Beef, Goat meat and Offals (internal organs) are ideal)
<br><br>
1 Cup Ogbono Seeds
<br><br>
2 Cooking Spoons Palm Oil
<br><br>
Ugu Leaves
<br><br>
3 Tablespoons Ground Crayfish
<br><br>
Dried Stockfish
<br><br>
1 Red Onion chopped
<br><br>
Tablespoon Cayenne Pepper (Atagungun)
<br><br>
Bouillon cubes (I’m using two Knorr cubes and 1 Maggi crayfish)
<br><br>

Salt to taste
<br><br>

<h1>METHOD:</h1>
Get your core ingredients ready… <br><br>
Grind your Ogbono seeds finely and set aside…<br><br>
Pick and wash the Ugu leaves with hot water to rid if of dirt.<br><br>
Be careful not to soak it in hot water for too long…<br><br>
After twenty minutes, turn up the heat to medium, add more water to cover the meats, cover and let this cook till tender, not soft, just tender. <br><br>
When it’s tender, add the softer meats, in this case, the goat meat, Also add the stock fish, continue to cook till meats are soft….<br><br>
After 5-6 minutes, take out the stockfish and shred to smaller pieces, now add the chopped pepper…<br><br>
Now add the ground pepper and ground crayfish<br><br>
Now add the palm oil, cook for another 3-5 minutes to allow the palm oil melt further and be well combined with the meats…<br><br>
Then,  add the Ogbono gradually, stir till fully dissolved ( the Soup should begin to draw at this time)<br><br>
Combine thoroughly and leave  to cook for at least 15 minutes, stir occasionally….<br><br>
Now add the washed Ugu leaves, turn the heat to low at this time….
Stir and  combine…<br><br>
then switch off the heat and let the soup simmer with the residual heat..
And that’s it, your Ogbono soup is ready. Serve with any swallow of your choice<br><br>
