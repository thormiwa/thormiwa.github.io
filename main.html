              <p>Yay!!! Afang Soup is one of the most popular traditional Nigerian soups. It is very nutritious, medicinal and native to the Efik people of Nigeria.</p>
              <p> This is the sister version of Edikang Ikong (recipe HERE), save for the difference with one vegetable, Okazi instead of Ugu.
              <p> Due to the texture of Okazi, you would have to pound or blend it. Now, this is where my disagreements with the soup start, so I usually go the Cameroon way </p> 
              <P>But for this post, I decided to let go of my personal preference for the benefit of you the readers, so you can replicate in your homes a truly Efik dish</p>

                <p>Okro soup is a very popular and delicious stew that is loved by the majority of the people, in West Africa, especially if cooked well. Okro soup has a viscous texture which makes it an acquired taste. </p>
                <p>Okra is also known as lady fingers, gumbo, ochro, or okro. It is a nutrient powerhouse, packed full of vitamins such as folate and vitamin c, and soluble and insoluble fiber.<p></p>

                  <p>It helps to reduce the risk of heart disease, keeps the intestinal tract healthy, and boosts the immune system, among other numerous benefits.</P>
                  
                 <P> The entire okra plant is edible; the leaves can be used for salads and the pods can be fried, stewed, pickled, boiled, or used as a thickener for soups.
